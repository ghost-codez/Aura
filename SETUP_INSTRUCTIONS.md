2. Try running in PowerShell: `python process_meeting.py`
3. Check that NLTK packages are downloaded

### **If no files are found:**

2. Place them in the same folder as `process_meeting.py`
3. The script automatically detects files with "transcript" in the name first

### **For PowerShell execution errors:**
