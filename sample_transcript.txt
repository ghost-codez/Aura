Hello team, thanks for joining. Let's get started. The main topic today is the Q3 marketing report. Alice, can you give us an update? Yes, the report is almost done. I will send the final draft to Bob by EOD Friday. We need to make a decision on the new ad campaign by next week. Bob, please follow up with the design agency. Also, remember the budget meeting is on October 28th, 2025. I think the sentiment on the new logo is generally positive. Let's circle back on the website analytics tomorrow.
